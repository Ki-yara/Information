  <h1><b><center><font color="crimson">HISTORY OF COMPUTER HARDWARE</font></center></b></h1>
  The history of computing hardware spans the developments from early devices used for simple calculations to today's complex computers, encompassing advancements in both analog and digital technology.

The first aids to computation were purely mechanical devices which required the operator to set up the initial values of an elementary arithmetic operation, then manipulate the device to obtain the result. In later stages, computing devices began representing numbers in continuous forms, such as by distance along a scale, rotation of a shaft, or a specific voltage level. Numbers could also be represented in the form of digits, automatically manipulated by a mechanism. Although this approach generally required more complex mechanisms, it greatly increased the precision of results. The development of transistor technology, followed by the invention of integrated circuit chips, led to revolutionary breakthroughs. Transistor-based computers and, later, integrated circuit-based computers enabled digital systems to gradually replace analog systems, increasing both efficiency and processing power. Metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) large-scale integration (LSI) then enabled semiconductor memory and the microprocessor, leading to another key breakthrough, the miniaturized personal computer (PC), in the 1970s. The cost of computers gradually became so low that personal computers by the 1990s, and then mobile computers (smartphones and tablets) in the 2000s, became ubiquitous.

  <h2><font color="slateblue"> What Is Software?</font></h2><br> 
  <font size="4.5">Simply put, software is the interface between computer systems and the humans who use them. Software consists of programming instructions and data that tell the computer how to execute various tasks. These days, instructions are generally written in a higher-level language, which is easier to use for human programmers, and then converted into low-level machine code that the computer can directly understand.</font><br> 

  <h2><i>The Early Days of Software</i></h2><br>

  <font size="4.5">Computer scientist Tom Kilburn is responsible for writing the world’s very first piece of software, which was run at 11 a.m. on June 21, 1948, at the University of Manchester in England. Kilburn and his colleague Freddie Williams had built one of the earliest computers, the Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (also known as the “Baby”). The SSEM was programmed to perform mathematical calculations using machine code instructions. This first piece of software took “only” 52 minutes to correctly compute the greatest divisor of 2 to the power of 18 (262,144).<br>
For decades after this groundbreaking event, computers were programmed with punch cards in which holes denoted specific machine code instructions. Fortran, one of the very first higher-level programming languages, was originally published in 1957. The next year, statistician John Tukey coined the word “software” in an article about computer programming. Other pioneering programming languages like Cobol, BASIC, Pascal and C arrived over the next two decades.</font>

  <h2><i> The Personal Computing Era</i></h2><br>

  <font size="4.5">In the 1970s and 1980s, software hit the big time with the arrival of personal computers. Apple released the Apple II, its revolutionary product, to the public in April 1977. VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet software for personal computing, was wildly popular and known as the Apple II’s killer app. The software was written in specialized assembly language and appeared in 1979.
Other companies like IBM soon entered the market with computers such as the IBM PC, which first launched in 1981. The next year, Time magazine selected the personal computer as its Man of the Year. Again, software for productivity and business dominated these early stages of personal computing. Many significant software applications, including AutoCAD, Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel, were released in the mid-1980s.
Open-source software, another major innovation in the history of software development, first entered the mainstream in the 1990s, driven mostly by the use of the internet. The Linux kernel, which became the basis for the open-source Linux operating system, was released in 1991. Interest in open-source software spiked in the late 1990s, after the 1998 publication of the source code for the Netscape Navigator browser, mainly written in C and C++. Also noteworthy is the release of Java by Sun Microsystems in 1995.</font>

  <h2><i> The Mobile Device</i></h2><br>

  <font size="4.5">The worlds very first mobile phone call was made on April 3, 1973. In 1993 IBM released the first publicly available “smartphone” and in 1996 Palm OS hit the market, bringing PDA’s to the masses. In 1999, RIM released the very first Blackberry 850 device and quickly became the worlds fastest growing company. Then, in 2007, Apple changed computing with the release of the iPhone. This is when mobile computing really found it’s place and mobile applications began to explode. Mobile apps are now a major part of development using languages like Swift and Java.</font>

  <h2><i>Software Development Today</i></font><br>

  <font size="4.5">Today, software has become ubiquitous, even in places that you might not expect it, from crock pots to nuclear submarines. Some programming languages, like C and Cobol, have survived the test of time and are still in use. Other languages, such as Java and Python, are somewhat younger and have been used in countless software development projects. Still others, such as Apple’s Swift programming language for iOS or Go Open source, are relatively new and exciting.</font>

  <h3><center><i>TELECOMMUNICATION NETWORKS </i></center></h3>
  
  A <b>telecommunications network</b> is a group of nodes interconnected by telecommunications links that are used to exchange messages between the nodes. The links may use a variety of technologies based on the methodologies of circuit switching, message switching, or packet switching, to pass messages and signals.

Multiple nodes may cooperate to pass the message from an originating node to the destination node, via multiple network hops. For this routing function, each node in the network is assigned a network address for identification and locating it on the network. The collection of addresses in the network is called the address space of the network.
  <br>
Examples of telecommunications networks include <i> computer networks, the Internet, the public switched telephone network (PSTN), the global Telex network, the aeronautical ACARS network,[1] and the wireless radio networks of cell phone telecommunication providers.</i>

  <h2>Types of networks that exist </h2>
There are different types of networks that can be classified depending on the area they cover or the type of data or technology they use. Some examples of networks that are commonly used today are: 
  <ol>
    <li><b>Local Area Networks (LANs)</b>
A local area network is a type of telecommunications network that connects electronic devices in a relatively small geographic area, such as a building, office, or home. 
These networks are designed to facilitate communication and data exchange between devices that are in physical proximity.</li><br> 
    <li><b>Wide Area Networks (WANs)</b>
Wide area networks are telecommunications networks that cover very large geographical areas, even interconnecting locations that are far away or globally. 
WANs are used in business environments to connect branches, offices, or retail outlets in industry, to remotely monitor and control devices, and in government and research applications for data transmission between distant locations.</li>
    <li><b> Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN)</b> 
A metropolitan area network is a telecommunications network that connects different locations within a city or metropolitan area, positioning itself as an intermediate solution between LAN networks and WAN networks. </li>
    <li><b>Wireless networks </b>
Wireless networks use communication technologies based on radio frequency or microwave signals to transmit data through the air, eliminating the need for physical connections via cables. 
This type of telecommunications network offers greater flexibility and mobility, since it is not necessary for the devices to be located in a fixed area. They are ideal networks for connecting mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, video surveillance cameras or laptops, among others. </li>
      <br><br>
    <u>Among the different kinds of wireless networks we have: </u><br>
* Based on radiofrequency technologies: Wi-Fi networks. 
    <br> * Using technologies like 3G, 4G or 5G: mobile phone networks.
