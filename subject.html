  <font size="5"><b><i><center>WHAT IS DATA?</center></i></b></h3> <br>
  Data refers to¬†raw, unorganized facts, figures, or symbols that can be processed and stored by computers, forming the foundation for information and knowledge.¬†</font> <br> <br>
  
  
  <font size="4.5"><h3><b><i>THE CHARACTERISTICS OF DATA</i></b></h3>
  <ul>
    <li><i>Data is unprocessed raw facts extracted from a primary or secondary source. It can also be unoragnised and discrete as it lacks context and isn't structured or processed to provide meaning or insights.</i></li>
    <li><i>Data can be <b>Qualitative</b>, meaning it is based on opinions or subjectives rather than quantities. It is non-numerical and is often collected through methods like interviews, observations, open-ended surveys, user feedback, and support tickets. In IT, qualitative data is especially useful when analyzing user experience (UX), software usability, interface design, and system satisfaction. <br> Two example of a qualitative data are, Users describing an app as "slow" or "confusing" and  a customer feedback saying "the website is easy to navigate" </i></li>
    <li><i>Data can be <b>Quantitaive</b>, meaning it is based on measureable data or objectives. It is a numerical data that can be measured, counted, and analyzed using statistical methods. It provides objective, concrete facts that are crucial for making data-driven decisions. In IT, quantitative data is commonly collected through tools like analytics software, system logs, performance metrics, surveys with closed-ended questions, and monitoring tools. <br> Two examples of a quantitative data are, the download count of an app and the number of person that completed ah task. </i></li>
    <li><i> Data can be <b>Detailed or Sampled</b>, depending on how it's collected. Detailed data involves recording information about every single instance of something,for example, capturing the test scores of every student in a school. On the other hand, Sampled data gathers information from a portion of the whole and uses it to represent the larger group, for example surveying every 20th customer who visits a supermarket to understand shopping preferences. This approach saves time and resources while still providing useful insights.</i></li> </font>

  <font size="5"><h3><b><i><center>WHAT IS INFORMATION?</center></i></b></h3>
  Information¬†is the output that results from analyzing, contextualizing, structuring, interpreting or in other ways processing data.</font>
  
  <font size="4.5"><h3><b><i>CHARACTERISTICS OF INFORMATION</i></b></h3>
  <ul>
    <li><i>For information to be effective, it must be <b>accurate</b>, ensuring that it correctly reflects the facts or situation.</i></li>
    <li><i>It should also be <b>relevant</b>, meaning it directly applies to the task or decision at hand.</i></li>
    <li><i><b>Timeliness</b> is another important trait, as outdated information can lead to poor decisions.</i></li>
    <li><i> Information must be <b>complete</b>, providing all the necessary details to understand a situation fully.</i></li>
    <li><i>It should also be <b>clear and understandable</b>, so that the people using it can easily interpret and act on it.</i></li>
    <li><i> A good information is <b>accessible</b>, meaning it is available when needed and easy to retrieve. </i></li> </font>
  </ul>
  <h4><i> These characteristics help ensure that information supports effective communication, planning, and decision-making in any environment.</i></h4> <br>
  
  <font size="4.5"><h3><i>TYPES OF INFORMATION: </i></h3>
  <ol>
    <li><i><b><font color="honeydew">Formal Information-</font></b></i></li>is official and comes from trusted or recognized sources. It is intended to be taken seriously and is typically presented in a structured and professional format. This type of information is often thoroughly prepared, reviewed, and verified before being shared, which means it tends to be more accurate and reliable than informal information. <br> Example: A government report on national exam results published by the Ministry of Education. It includes detailed statistics, is professionally formatted, and has been reviewed for accuracy before release.
    <li><i><b><font color="honeydew">Informal Information-</font></b></i></li>is unofficial and often shared in casual or everyday situations. It may come from conversations, social media, text messages, or personal opinions. Unlike formal information, it is usually not reviewed or verified before being shared, so its accuracy and reliability may vary. However, informal information can still be useful, especially for gaining insights, understanding public opinions, or making quick decisions in less critical situations. <br> Example: A WhatsApp message from a friend saying, ‚ÄúI heard the math exam was really hard this year!‚Äù It‚Äôs casual, based on personal opinion or hearsay, and not officially verified.</font>
  </ol> <br> <br> <br> <br> 
  
 

<b><center><font size="5">FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE QUALITY OF INFORMATION </font></center></b><br> 
<font size="4.5"><i>These can reduce effectiveness or create issues:
  <ul>
    <li><i><font color="honeydew"><b>Distortion-</b></font></i></li>
   This occurs when information is altered, changed, or manipulated in a way that misrepresents the facts. It may happen intentionally (e.g., to deceive) or unintentionally (e.g., through a mistake or misunderstanding). Distorted information can lead to incorrect conclusions, poor decision-making, or misunderstanding of the issue at hand. <br> 
    Examples: <ol> <li> A news report that exaggerates the severity of a natural disaster to attract more viewers.</li>
     <li>A business report where data is manipulated to make a company‚Äôs performance seem better than it is</li>
   </ol>
    <li><i><b><font color="honeydew">Disguise-</font></b></i></li>
        Disguise refers to hiding or concealing the true meaning or origin of the information. This can occur in situations where the source or the nature of the information is deliberately obscured, leading to uncertainty or confusion about its authenticity and reliability.
    <br>Examples:<ol><li>A company hiding the true source of its products in marketing to appear more ethical than it is.</li> <li>A politician presenting facts in a way that hides the actual consequences or context of a decision.</li></ol>
    <li><i><b><font color="honeydew">Inconsistency-</font></b></i></li>
    Inconsistency arises when the information contradicts itself or conflicts with other information. This can occur when the same data or message is presented in different ways, making it hard to trust the information or make informed decisions.
    <br> Examples: <ol><li>A report showing different financial data in two sections of the same document.</li>
      <li>A health study showing conflicting results on the effectiveness of a particular medication.</li>
    </ol>
    <li><i><b><font color="honeydew">Incomprehensible-</font></b></i></li>
    Incomprehensible information is difficult to understand due to unclear language, complex jargon, poor organization, or missing context. If information is incomprehensible, it can‚Äôt be effectively used, regardless of how accurate or valuable it might be.
    <br>Examples: <ol><li>A technical manual written in highly specialized language that non-experts can't follow.</li>
      <li> A legal contract full of complicated terminology that a regular person cannot easily understand.</li>
    </ol>
    <li><i><b><font color="honeydew">Subject to Interpretation-</font></b></i></li>
    Information that is subject to interpretation can be understood in multiple ways depending on the perspective, background, or biases of the person receiving it. While some level of interpretation is inevitable, excessive ambiguity can cause confusion or disagreement.
    <br>Examples: <ol><li> A piece of art that can be interpreted in different ways by different viewers.</li>
      <li> A vague political statement that can be understood in multiple ways depending on one‚Äôs political viewpoint.</li>
    </ol> <br> <br> <br>

      <H2><center><b><u>WHAT IS KNOWLEDGE?</u></b></center></H2>
      <font size="4.5"><i> Knowledge is the understanding and application of information to support decision-making or solve problems.¬†It builds upon information by adding context, experience, interpretation, and judgment, ultimately enabling informed actions and innovative solutions</i></font> 
            
      <h3>Use of Information for Decision-Making in IT</h3><br>  
In IT environments, decision-making is data-driven. Whether it's developing software, designing databases, managing networks, or analyzing system performance, the quality and relevance of data determine how effective your choices will be.
      <br> <br> 
      <ol>
        <li> <font color="honeydew">DATA QUALITY :</font> </li><br>
        This refers to how trustworthy and usable the data is in technical systems. Poor quality data can lead to system errors, security flaws, and failed projects.<br> <br> 
        <u>Key Dimensions of Data Quality in IT:</u><br>
        <ul>
          <li><b> Accuracy:</b> Data reflects the real-world values it represents.<br> Example: Customer email addresses must be correctly spelled to send updates.</li>
          <li><b>Completeness:</b> No missing fields or essential data gaps.<br> Example: A database record missing a phone number might prevent verification.</li>
          <li><b>Consistency:</b>Data is uniform across systems and platforms.<br> Example: If a user‚Äôs name appears as ‚ÄúJane Doe‚Äù in one table and ‚ÄúJ. Doe‚Äù in another, that‚Äôs a consistency issue.</li>
          <li><b> Timeliness:</b>Data is current and up to date. <br>Example: Outdated antivirus signature files make a system vulnerable.</li>
          <li><b> Validity:</b>Data conforms to defined formats or rules. <br> Example: An input for ‚ÄúDate of Birth‚Äù must follow the format DD/MM/YYYY.</li>  
        </ul>
       
      <h3><i> Decisions about system upgrades, security protocols, or data analytics depend on having high-quality data. Bad data = bad results.</i></h3>

        <li><font color="honeydew">APPROPRIATENESS OF DATA:</font> </li><br>
Appropriateness refers to how well the data fits the specific technical task or decision. Even clean, high-quality data is useless if it‚Äôs not relevant to the purpose.<br> <br> 
        <u> Questions to assess appropriateness: </u><br>
        <ul>
          <li><b> Is this the right type of data? (e.g., text, image, numerical)</b> Data reflects the real-world values it represents.<br></li>
          <li><b> Is the level of detail appropriate for the task?</b> </li> 
          <li><b>Is the data context-specific? (e.g., localized data vs. global data)</b></li> 
          <li><b>Is it compatible with the system being used?</b></li> 
        </ul> <br> 
        <b><i>Examples:</i> </b><br>
* Using global internet usage stats may not help when you're designing a local-area network.
        <br>
* Collecting real-time sensor data is more appropriate than static reports when programming a smart home system.
        <br><br><br>
        <b><i> Inappropriate data leads to:</i></b> 
        <br>
* Mismatched requirements
        <br>
* System inefficiency
        <br>
* Misguided conclusions
