    <font color="honeydew"><h3>Key Areas of Computing in IT:</h3></font>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Hardware & Infrastructure:</b></li>
    This area focuses on the physical components of computing, including processors (CPU), memory (RAM), and storage devices (HDD, SSD). It also includes servers, data centers, and networking equipment that power enterprise IT systems. The rise of IoT has introduced smart devices that enhance connectivity and automation across industries.

    <li><b>Software Development:</b></li>
    Software development involves creating applications and systems using programming languages like Python, Java, and C++. It includes web and mobile app development, software engineering practices, and DevOps, which streamline development and deployment processes. Efficient software development enhances user experience and business operations.

    <li><b>Data Management & Databases:</b></li>
    Data management involves storing, organizing, and analyzing data using relational (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis) databases. Big data processing allows organizations to extract valuable insights from vast datasets, improving decision-making. Proper database management ensures data security, integrity, and accessibility.

    <li><b>Networking & Communication</b></li>
    Networking connects computers and devices via LAN, WAN, and VPNs, enabling data exchange and collaboration. Internet protocols like TCP/IP, along with cloud computing (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), enhance connectivity and accessibility. Wireless technologies like Wi-Fi, 5G, and Bluetooth improve mobile and IoT interactions.

    <li><b>Cybersecurity & Information Assurance</b></Li>
    Cybersecurity protects IT systems from threats using encryption, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems (IDS). Ethical hacking and penetration testing help identify vulnerabilities before cybercriminals exploit them. Ensuring cybersecurity is crucial for maintaining data privacy and preventing cyberattacks.

    <li><b>Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Machine Learning (ML)</b></li>
    AI and ML enhance automation by enabling machines to learn and adapt from data. Neural networks and deep learning improve pattern recognition, while NLP enables machines to understand human language. AI applications range from chatbots to advanced robotics, transforming various industries.

    <li><b>Cloud Computing & Virtualization</b></li>
    Cloud computing offers scalable services (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS) that reduce the need for on-premise infrastructure. Virtualization technologies like VMs and containers (Docker, Kubernetes) improve resource efficiency. Edge computing further enhances performance by processing data closer to the source.

    <li><b>Operating Systems & System Administration</b></li>
    Operating systems like Windows, Linux, and macOS manage hardware and software resources. System administrators ensure security, user management, and automation using scripts. Efficient system administration keeps IT environments stable, secure, and optimized for business needs.

Software engineering is crucial for creating technology that powers businesses, healthcare, gaming, and everyday applications.
    Mobile Apps, Web Development, Game development, Enterprise Software and Cybersecurity Software are some examples of SE. </font>
    <li><i><font color="honeydew"><h3><b>Computer Engineering(CE)</b>-</h3></font></i></li>
    <font size="4.5">Computer engineering combines electrical engineering and computer science to design and develop computer hardware and software. It involves building and improving computer systems, including processors, circuit boards, and embedded systems. Computer engineers work on both the hardware (physical components) and software (programming) of computing devices. They design systems that can process and store data efficiently, like personal computers and mobile devices. Their work enables the creation of new technologies, from everyday gadgets to high-performance computing systems.
    Five examples of Computer Engineering Applications are Embedded systems(e.gs. smart-tvs,calculator),Processor design,Robotics,Mobile devices(e.gs Smartphones,tablets),and Network Equipment(e.gs. Routers,Modems)</font>
    <li><i><font color="honeydew"><h3><b> Information Systems(IS)</b>-</h3></font></i></li>
    <font size="4.5">An Information System is a set of components that work together to collect, process, store, and distribute information. It involves both technology (hardware and software) and people working to support business operations, decision-making, and communication. Information systems help organizations manage data efficiently and improve productivity. They can be used for tasks like tracking inventory, managing finances, or analyzing customer behavior. The goal is to streamline processes and provide accurate, timely information for decision-making.
    <b>Transaction rocessing Systems (TPS), Management Information Systems(MIS), Decision Support Systems (DSS),Executive Information Systems (EIS),Office Automation System(OAS), and Expert Systems (ES)</b> are examples of Information Systems.</font> <br> <br> <br>
